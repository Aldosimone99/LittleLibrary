# LittleLibrary

LittleLibrary is a web application built with Angular that allows users to search for books by category and view detailed information about each book. The application fetches data from the Open Library API.

## Features

- Search for books by category
- View book details including title, author, cover image, and description
- Responsive design for a seamless experience on different devices

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aldosimone/LittleLibrary.git
cd LittleLibrary
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
